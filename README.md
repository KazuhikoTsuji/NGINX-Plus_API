# NGINX-Plus API.
This tool is for operating upstream which is running in NGINX Plus by using REST API.  
First of all, you need to edit "target.txt" according to your environment.  
And then, you can start to operate your environment by executing "operation.sh".  
  
Note:  
The environment I evaluated this script is "Ubuntu 16.04.5".  
I hope that this tool works well on your environment.  
  
Best.
